    <figcaption id="img-caption"> Thomas Hearns was an American professional boxer who competed at the very apex of the sport for just short of three decades (1977 to 2006). Largely unknown by his first nickname ‘Tiger Tommy’, Hearns subsequently became the ‘Motor City Cobra’ (his preferred moniker), before most famously assuming his ‘nom de guerre’ of ‘The Hitman’ as he blitzed and blazed his way through the professional ranks and weights. </figcaption>
